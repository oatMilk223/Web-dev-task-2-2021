    <h3>Reliable</h3>
  <p>With newer models introduced every year, tablets have proven to stand apart from pcs,
    especially in terms of increasing durability standards. Some common features which showcase
    this are increased speed, battery life and overall efficiency. If you own an old computer and 
    would prefer a longer lasting, speedier (and compact) device, perhaps tablets are for you.
  </p><br>

       <h3>Sustainable</h3>
       <p>Thanks to the increasing importance of sustainable business practices, many tablet companies
         strive to maintain eco-friendly and ethical produce methods. As a result, reputable brands 
         produce tablets which were made whilst taking consideration of the planet in mind. Newer additions
         implemented in the hardware of tablets (as opposed to old pcs) consist of safer-to-dispose
         materials which are much more eco-friendly.
       </p><br>

           <h3>Innovative</h3>
           <p>The compact and efficient nature of tablets make them a popular product for consumers.
             Because of increasing demand, many companies value creating innovation where it's appreciated.
             Since the popular acceptance of tablets as every day devices, there has been a steep increase 
             in innovative features  for the design of tablets. Every year new tablets are released for sale,
             there is a clear distinction from how each version has improved over such a short time. If you are
             hoping to obtain a product that increases its quality drastically, tablets are for you.
